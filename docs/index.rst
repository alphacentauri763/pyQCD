Welcome to pyQCD's documentation!
=================================

pyQCD provides a python library for running lattice simulations on desktop
and workstation computers. Whilst not being as fully featured as Chroma or
UKHADRON, the aim of of pyQCD is to retain a simple and transparent design
that will hopefully make it easy to use. By providing a straightforward
interface to Python, we also hope that the analysis of any simulation data
will be that much easier.
